This is a Java based webapp to create rules and add checks for Checkstyle (http://checkstyle.sf.net).
Checkstyle typically needs a config file that is used for validating the contents of Java files and
is run commandline or using Ant. 

This project attempts to web-ify this. You can look at all existing checks available, add a new check
into the repository, add a new rule (config file) containing checks that are available as well as
validate whether an uploaded file will match the given checks.

Its still at its infancy, and the only functionalities that work are
 * List all Checks
 * Create rule using existing checks
 * Upload a Java file and validate against a rule
